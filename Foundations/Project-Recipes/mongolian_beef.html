    <h3 align = "center">  As I mentioned, Mongolian beef (or Mongolian meatloaf) has absolutely nothing to do with Mongolian cuisine. Apparently, it’s a Taiwanese dish that made its way to American-Chinese restaurants. But, horribly inaccurate names aside, this is an easy-to-make flavor bomb. I loved how this came out. You can easily adapt this to other ground meats (I think lamb, pork, chicken, or turkey would all work beautifully). Regardless of what you use, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! </h4>

        <li>1 cup cooked rice, cold or at room temperature </li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>

    </ul>
    </n>
    </n>
    <h2 align ="left">Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 rounded teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 align="left"> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly oil a loaf pan.</li>
            
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and sauté yellow onions with a pinch of salt until they start to turn golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cloves crushed garlic and 2 teaspoons ginger, and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Add cooled onion mixture to ground beef along with egg, green onions, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, and black pepper. Use a fork, spatula, or your hands to mix together until evenly combined. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, press in firmly, and smooth the top.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C). Meatloaf can be served hot, or let cool, wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes</li>
            <li>For the sauce, combine 2 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon ginger, and 4 minced garlic cloves in a cold nonstick skillet.</li>
            <li> Turn heat on to medium-high. Once ginger and garlic start to sizzle, cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, then whisk in brown sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, ketchup, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water togehter in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir into the sauce. Raise heat to medium-high and return to a simmer. Cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until needed (Sauce may be made ahead and reheated on medium-low heat).</li>
            <li>Remove cold meatloaf from the refrigerator and slice into 8 portions. Dust each side with cornstarch, and reheat over medium high heat in a nonstick skillet in a little bit of vegetable oil until browned and heated through. If surface browns before meatloaf is heated through, reduce heat to medium, and cover until done.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with the sauce; garnish with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
        </ol>
